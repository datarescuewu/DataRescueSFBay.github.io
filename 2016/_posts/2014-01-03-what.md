# What

The U.S. federal government hosts a multitide of datasets, mainly through executive branch agencies like the EPA, NASA, NOAA, the Department of Energy, and the Department of the Interior. Recently, many in the federal government at a variety of levels have communicated their antagonism toward the scientists, researchers, and civil servants who study and inform the public about a wide variety of topics. The federal government has already moved to expunge information related to climate change from [whitehouse.gov](whitehouse.gov) and introduced legislation to [abolish the EPA](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/861). We seek to protect vital public scientific and data resources from suppression by archiving them in multiple, redundant repositories so they may be accessed and reused after potentially disappearing.
